Guidelines

Please include a sample image or two showing off your shader goodness. If unsure how to do this, you can view a good example on the SkinShader2 page, as a reference.
Official Shaders

    Built In Shaders - Here you can get the sourcecode for all the shaders that are built into Unity. 

Unity 3.x Shaders

    MatCap - A bumped shader without lighting, for use with materials from programs like ZBrush.
    Fur (Unity3) - A remake for Unity 3 support of a fur shader by Jonathan Czeck found in unity
    Skin Shader 3 - The classic skin shader redone for Unity 3 by forum user bournifle
    Planet - A shader which adds an atmosphere and shading for one pointlight source to a planet.
    Dissolve With Texture - A simple shader which dissolves objects, using an image as guidance.
    TransparentShadowCaster - Can handle transparency and takes it into account for casting shadows. 

Post Processing Shaders(Unity Pro only)

    Dream - Blurs screen.
    EdgeDetect - Detects Edges.
    Emboss - Emboss filter.
    Frost - Freezes screen like in crysis (sort of).
    NightVision - Night Vision effect.
    Pixelated - Pixelates screen.
    ThermalVision - Thermal view like in Predator movies.
    Waves - Screen waves (can be used for underwater or delirious moments like in Amnesia game). 

Unity 2.x Shaders
Porting Shaders

    ShaderPortingNotes - Some guidelines for porting shaders between FX composer, RenderMonkey, Mental Mill, ShaderFX and Unity 

Debugging

    BarycentricWireframeUv1 - A wireframe shader for barycentric uvs. 

    Delta - Visualize loss of detail caused by texture compression. 

    NormalSmoothing - Visualize normal smoothing. 


Fullscreen Effects (Unity Pro only)

    ColorBlindness - Coarse simulation of what your game might look like to someone who is red/green colorblind.
    DreamBlurEffect - Yet another bloom/glow style effect (Post Render Effect, requires Unity Pro)
    RefractionEffect - Fullscreen refraction effect. Can be used for raindrops, blood, underwater effects and others. Including color and color mask. 

FX

    Anisotropic 2.x - Updated anisotropic lighting for version 2.x
    DepthMask - For cutting holes in objects without changing geometry.
    DesaturatedDarks2 - Non-lit areas are desaturated; lights "saturate" the colors (updated for v2).
    FXHyperbolicStatic - Special effect for things like force fields.
    FXHyperbolicStaticParticle - Special effect for things like energy balls with particle systems.
    FXTrigField - Special effect for things like force fields.
    MirrorReflection2 - A shader and script to make reflective mirrors.
    Shield - A shader and script to make Shields spheres around your units (works with other shapes too).
    TextureMask - A simple shader that will allow you to mask of parts of a texture.
    Unlit - A shader that doesn't use lighting, useful for dashboard and other 3D GUI components.
    Binary - Limits down textured models to 2 individual colors.
    ProjectorAdditive - A shader for the projector component that does an additive/screen effect as opposed to multiply.
    XRay - Additive X-Ray shader.
    Planet - A shader which adds an atmosphere and per pixel lighting to your planets.
    Fur - A basic fur shader with some minor(?) sorting problems. 

General

    BakedVertexColorBumpSpec2 - Lightmap in vertex colors, bumped specular.
    BumpSpecRim - Bumpmapped specular with fake rim light affected by bump map.
    BumpColorSpec - Bumpmapped specular with colored specular map.
    ReflectiveVertexlitSimple - Simplified Reflective VertexLit shader, with a slider to control amount instead of alpha channel.
    SkinShader2 - Shadow-supporting wrapped-diffuse+ specular + bumped + rim + fresnel shader. Good for skin shading!
    3SideProjDiffuse - Per pixel shaded autotexturing. No need for an UV-Map!
    3SideProjDiffuse1.1 - Added the option of selecting different textures for X, Y and Z coordinates.
    ReliefDiffuse - Bumpmapped reliefmapping shader.
    ReliefSpecular - Bumpmapped reliefmapping shader with specularity. 

Interface

    3DText - Use this instead of the default shader when creating 3D Text, so the text doesn't always appear on top of objects.
    TexturedFont - Use this shader in place of the built in Text Shader for multicolored fonts instead of solid colored ones. 

iPhone

These shaders are targeted at the original iPhone and iPod touch.

    Blend 2 Textures - Blends two textures based on a slider, with an option to use light from Simply Lit
    Blend 2 Textures by Lightmap Alpha - A lightmapped shader that blends two tiling textures based on a splatmap.
    Masked Tint - Selectively tint your models based on a mask; render multiple differently-colored objects with only one total draw call.
    Simply Lit - Uses ambient and diffuse vertex lighting to affect a single texture.
    Texture Only - Maps a 2D texture onto your model, in 3D!
    VertexColorUnlit - Two shaders for using with vertex-colored meshes; allows overbrightening
    iPhoneGems -Using the gem .unitypackage from the unity website will cause poor gem shading on the iphone, this is their code including an update to the sub-shader that makes nicer iphone gems. 

Terrain

    LayerShader - A terrain shader that mixes two tileable textures.
    TerrainTwoLayerBumped - A terrain shader that mixes two tileable textures, plus a bumpmap.
    TerrainFourLayerDiffuseFast - A terrain shader that mixes four tileable textures, and also works like the Diffuse Fast shader.
    TerrainFourLayer2Pass - A terrain shader that mixes four tileable textures; should work on all modern cards and has fog.
    FourSplatBlendWrapShader - A terrain shader that mixes and wraps 4 diffuse splats from a 4x4 texture sheet. 

Toon

    ToonShadowed - Variant of the Toon-Basic shader that receives shadows.
    OutlinedDiffuse - Variant of the Toon-Basic shader that uses diffuse shading for surfaces 

Transparent

    AlphaClipsafe - Like Particles/Alpha Blended, but fades out before it intersects the camera's near clipping plane.
    AlphaSelfIllum - Textures object which is unaffected by light.
    AlphaVertexLitZ - Just like Transparent/VertexLit, but with proper depth buffering. Useful for objects that need to fade out.
    UnlitAlphaWithFade - Unlit shader similar to AlphaSelfIllum, but with the alpha of the colour taken into account to allow fading.
    AlphaDiffuse2sided - Transparent 2-sided rendering
